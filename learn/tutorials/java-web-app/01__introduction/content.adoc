Welcome to _Web App Development in Java: A practical guide_. 

This guide is specifically designed as a *practical* introduction to web application development using Java.
It covers the entire development process, from setup to deployment, following a step-by-step approach. 
You can replicate each section at your own pace as you follow along. 

The content is suitable for anyone familiar with Java who wants to build a web application.
To make sure your development experience is enjoyable and productive, we start right from the beginning with setting up your development environment.

== What you'll learn

This guide teaches you how to build a functional, full-stack web app using modern Java.
It focuses on real-world developer needs, without diving deeply into theory or academics.
Links to relevant further reading are provided for those who are interested. 

The application is a customer relationship management (CRM) system for managing contacts. It features:

* A login screen to restrict access.
* A responsive layout with side navigation that works on desktop and mobile.
* A database for persistent data storage.
* A list view that can be sorted and filtered.
* A form to edit and add contacts.
* Data import from a REST API.
* A dashboard view.
* Cloud deployment.
* User installation.

== Tools and frameworks

The frameworks and tools used in the guide were chosen for two reasons: they are easy to use, and they are suitable for both learning and production use. 

On the *back end*, the application uses *https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]*.
This eliminates most of the hassle of setting up and running a Spring-based app and lets you focus on your own code.
The main features you'll use are:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection[Dependency injection] to decouple components.
* https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA] repositories to work with the database.
* https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security] to handle access control.
* An embedded http://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat] server to serve the application.
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-devtools[Spring Boot Developer Tools] to provide a smoother development experience.

Don't worry if you don't know what all of these are, we cover each individually as we go.

On the *front end*, the application uses *https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin]* 
This is an open-source Java web app framework that comes with:

* https://vaadin.com/components[A large library of UI components]. Each component has a Java API and you can customize the look and feel.
* A router for navigating between views.
* A powerful data-binding system for forms and lists.
