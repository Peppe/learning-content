In this series of tutorials, you learn how to build an application using Web Components and LitElement. The topics we cover are:

. Starting a LitElement project
. lit-html templating and events
. State management with Redux
. Navigation and code splitting
. PWA and offline

.The app we are building

== Download the LitElement starter
We are using https://webpack.js.org/[Webpack^] to serve the application during development and for building the application for production. This tutorial does not cover Webpack configuration. Instead, we start with a pre-configured project skeleton. 


https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/lit-element-tutorial-00-starter/archive/master.zip[Download LitElement starter, role="cta"]

Once you have downloaded the starter, unzip it and run:

[source,terminal]
$ npm install

Then start the development server and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

[source,terminal]
$ npm run dev

If everything went well, you should see the empty application. You are now ready to get started!

== Creating the first component

Start by installing LitElement.

[source,terminal]
$ npm install --save @polymer/lit-element

Create a new folder `*views*` in the `*src*` folder, and create a file `*todo-view.js*` in it. We always name our files the same as their HTML tag names to make it easier to navigate the source. 

.`*views/todo-view.js*`
[source,javascript]
----
import { LitElement, html } from '@polymer/lit-element'; //<1>

class TodoView extends LitElement { //<2>
  render() {
    return html` //<3>
      <p>todo-view</p>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('todo-view', TodoView); //<4>
----
<1> Import the `LitElement` base class and `html` template function
<2> Create a class for the component, extending `LitElement`
<3> Define a template in the `render()` function using the `html` template function.
<4> Associate the component implementation with a HTML tag using the CustomElements registry. 

NOTE: Tag names need to have a dash (-) to avoid naming collisions with native HTML elements. 

Once we have a component definition, we need to import it to the browser is aware of it. The Webpack configuration takes care of including the JavaScript in our app.

.`*index.js*`
[source,javascript]
----
import './styles.css';
import './views/todo-view.js'; 
----

Now we can use the component like any other HTML tag. Let's add it to the `<main>` section of the index file. 

.`*index.html*`
[source,html]
----
...
  <main>
    <todo-view></todo-view> 
  </main>
...
----

NOTE: Custom elements need to have a closing tag. 

If you still have the development server (`npm run dev`) running, you should see the new component running:

In the next tutorial, we will implement the todo view.
